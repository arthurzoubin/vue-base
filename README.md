# Vue Base

> Vue Base is a repository that helps anyone create new JavaScript applications. Giving you a technically sound and well tested starting point for your application.

### Quick Start
Use the following commands to get started on your new app.

```
git clone https://github.com/arthurzoubin/vue-base.git <directory-name>
cd <directory-name>
npm i
npm start
```

Default, this will start your application in development mode on port 8090.

Open a browser window at `127.0.0.1:8090`.

### Technology stack

Vue Base uses the following libraries at its core:

##### Build tools
- [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - A module bundler.
- [babel](http://babeljs.io/) - A JavaScript compiler.

npm run dev

# build for production with minification
